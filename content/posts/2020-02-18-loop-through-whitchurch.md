Bla bla.

The preferred way to organize the posts is as Org subtrees (also the main reason to write this package, as nothing like that was out there) as it makes the meta-data management for Hugo front-matter pretty effortless.

If you are a one Org-file per post type of a person, that flow works too! Just
note that in this flow many of those #+hugo\_ properties need to be managed
manually.. just as one would manage the front-matter in Markdown files â€” See
the Org versions in the above screenshots for comparison.
